    "text": "This project proposes a visual-based trend prediction trading strategy using Japanese candlestick patterns and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The approach is inspired by the methodology of Mersal et al.¬†(2024), with key adaptations to suit our dataset and simplified implementation.\n\n\nWe use a sliding window approach to generate candlestick chart segments (5 candles per window).
