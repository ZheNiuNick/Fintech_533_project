    "text": "This project proposes a visual-based trend prediction trading strategy using Japanese candlestick patterns and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The approach is inspired by the methodology of Mersal et al. (2024), with key adaptations to suit our dataset and simplified implementation.\n\n\nWe use a sliding window approach to generate candlestick chart segments (5 candles per window). For each window:\n\nIdentify patterns using ta-lib\nUse CNN to classify pattern as bullish or bearish\nBased on the predicted trend, enter a trade on the next candle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 5-candle sliding window is fed into the trained CNN model.\nCNN outputs: Uptrend (probability: 0.91)\nEntry Condition:\n\nPredicted trend = “Uptrend”\nThe last candle in the window closes above the 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA20)\n\n\n✅ Enter a Long Position (Buy) at the opening of the next candle\n\n\n\n\nExit after 3 candles (fixed holding period), OR:\nIf CNN prediction flips to Downtrend in an overlapping future window\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace a stop loss at 1.5 × ATR(14) below the entry price\nNo more than 2% of portfolio risked per trade\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one active trade at a time\nNo trades during low-volume periods (overnight hours or holidays)"
