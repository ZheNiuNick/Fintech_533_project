This is a simple test to verify if pandas can read the CSV files from the source directory.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Test if pandas is working
print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)

# Try to read the blotter.csv file
try:
    blotter = pd.read_csv('source/blotter.csv')
    print("\nSuccessfully read blotter.csv!")
    print(f"Shape: {blotter.shape}")
    print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
    print(blotter.head())
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error reading blotter.csv: {e}")

# Try to read the ledger.csv file
try:
    ledger = pd.read_csv('source/ledger.csv')
    print("\nSuccessfully read ledger.csv!")
    print(f"Shape: {ledger.shape}")
    print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
    print(ledger.head())
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error reading ledger.csv: {e}")
```
